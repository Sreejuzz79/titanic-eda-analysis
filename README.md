# Titanic EDA Analysis
This repository contains a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) performed on the Titanic dataset. The analysis is designed to uncover patterns, correlations, anomalies, and insights from the dataset through statistical summaries and a variety of visualizations.
## Objectives
- Perform statistical analysis and visualization on the Titanic dataset
- Understand relationships between features
- Detect missing values, outliers, and potential data imbalances
- Provide feature-level insights that can inform machine learning models
## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Plotly (for interactive visualizations)
- Google Colab (for execution)
## Features of This EDA
### 1. Summary Statistics
- Display of descriptive statistics including mean, median, standard deviation, min/max values.
### 2. Univariate Analysis
- Histograms and boxplots for all numeric features.
- Count plots for categorical features.
### 3. Bivariate Analysis
- Correlation matrix and heatmap for identifying feature relationships.
- Pairplots for visualizing distributions and scatter relationships.
- Interactive scatter matrix using Plotly for dynamic exploration.
### 4. Missing Values & Data Imbalance
- Identification and count of missing values.
- Frequency distribution of categorical variables.
### 5. Feature Correlation Insights
- Printed matrix of highly correlated features (threshold > 0.7).
## How to Use
1. Open the provided `.ipynb` notebook in Google Colab.
2. Upload the Titanic dataset (CSV format) when prompted.
3. Run each cell sequentially to generate visualizations and statistical outputs.
## Prerequisites
